## FAQs

#### Can I select images and then search for more before adding images?
No. If you want to do another keyword search add selected images before continuing as it will reset the page

#### Can I delete images one by one?
Yes! Same way you delete any image from the WordPress media library.

#### Does using the delete images function delete images I upload outside of this plugin?
No. When you add a image to the library it records the ID generated into a custom database field. Using the delete function only deletes the images in that database record.

#### Do I need to generate an API key for every site?
Whils I recommend it, it is not necessary. However free keys are limited (50 requests per hour at time of writing) which is why I recommend it.

#### Can I hide the description when using the shortcode?
Absolutely, just add description=false to your shortcode

#### Is this theme or plugin dependant?
No. I built this to be a stand alone plugin. It does not rely on any plugins or frameworks to function as everything is created and coded by myself, including the gallery field. It only relies on the Unsplash API

#### Can I use this without an API Key?
No, the key is free to get however.

### Why did you create this when there is a plugin from Unsplash already?
I found the plugin was giving me issues with scrolling and loading more images when doing a search as well as I did not like how I had to use it as part of adding Featured Image. I wanted to be able to bulk add images at the start of the project. As a web developer I find myself using unsplash to generate placeholders to show the site to client, not as content to stay when going live, so I also wanted a way to bulk delete all the placeholder images used.
